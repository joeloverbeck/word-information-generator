# word-information-generator
Given a word passed as a command-line argument, the program generates a styled HTML page with plenty of useful information about that word.

## Installation instructions
+ Ensure that you have Python installed. I wrote the code based on Python 3.11.
+ Install the requirements through the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
+ Execute the program through the following command:
```
python main.py [WORD]
```

The program will indicate if it has been able to create the output HTML. You will find it in the *output* directory.
